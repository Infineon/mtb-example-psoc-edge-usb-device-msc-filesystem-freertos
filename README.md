# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: emUSB-device FatFs MSC file system

This example demonstrates the usage of Segger's emUSB-device middleware to set up the USB block of PSOC&trade; Edge MCU as a Mass Storage Class (MSC) device and run the ([FatFs](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html)) file system through an external memory (microSD). This example is based on FreeRTOS.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.
> **Note:** On the KIT_PSE84_HMI, all three projects are programmed to the external OSPI flash instead of QSPI.

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.7 or later (tested with v3.8)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`) – Default value of `TARGET`
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 HMI Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_HMI) (`KIT_PSE84_HMI`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position for the PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Insert a microSD card in the SD slot. See the kit guide to know the location of microSD card slot

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: emUSB-Device FatFs Mass Storage File System" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 1. Program startup output**

5. Press the User button 1 (**USER BTN1**) to read the data from *readme.txt* file from the SD card

   **Figure 2. Reading the file content from SD card**

   ![](images/usbd-msc-startup-output2.png)

6. If any error occurs on creating files or folders, you can force the firmware to format the file system:

   1. Keep the kit User button 1 (**USER BTN1**) pressed for 3 seconds

   2. Observe that the message indicating that the file system is being formatted is displayed on the serial terminal as shown in the following figure

      **Figure 3. Formatting the file system**

      ![](images/usbd-msc-filesystem-formatting.png)

7. Connect another USB cable (or reuse the same cable used to program the kit) to the device USB connector (see the kit user guide for its location). Note that the enumeration process might take a few seconds

8. To access the SD card connected through your MCU kit's USB, open the File Explorer in your PC. A new removable drive will appear, representing the SD card

9. Open *readme.txt* from the removable drive using a text editor. Modify or update the text and Save the file back to the USB drive (the removable drive associated with your MCU kit)<br>

    > **Note:** Your operating system (OS) might briefly show a "writing" or "syncing" message

10. Press the User button 1 (**USER BTN1**) to read the updated data from the *readme.txt* file from the SD card. Verify the output on the serial terminal as shown in the following figure

    **Figure 4. Reading the text updated via PC from the SD card**
